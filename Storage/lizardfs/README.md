# LizardFS | openEuler
Current LizardFS docker images are built on the [openEuler](https://repo.openeuler.org/). This repository is free to use and exempted from per-user rate limits.

LizardFS is a fork of MooseFS and shares a similar design and core components. It continues MooseFSâ€™s overall architecture, where the mfsmaster (Master Server) plays a central role. The mfsmaster manages metadata, file namespace, and coordinates chunkservers, making it the key component for the distributed file system to function properly.

# Usage
In this usage, users can select the corresponding `{Tag}` based on their requirements.

- Pull the `openeuler/lizardfs` image from docker

	```bash
	docker pull openeuler/lizardfs:{Tag}
	```

- Run with an interactive shell

    You can also start the container with an interactive shell to use lizardfs.
    ```
    docker run -it --rm openeuler/lizardfs:{Tag} bash
    ```

- Create mfsmaster.cfg

    Create mfs configuration directory:
    ```
    mkdir -p /etc/mfs
    ```
  
    Create mfs configuration file `/etc/mfs/mfsmaster.cfg`:
    ```
    DATA_PATH = /var/lib/mfs
    EXPORTS_FILENAME = /etc/mfs/mfsexports.cfg

    WORKING_USER = root
    WORKING_GROUP = root
    ```

- Create mfsexports.cfg

    `/etc/mfs/mfsexports.cfg`:
    ```
    * / rw,alldirs,maproot=0
    ```
  
- Create empty optional files

    For single-node tests, these can be empty. There're used for rack/host mapping and advanced topology placement.
    * `/etc/mfs/mfstopology.cfg`
    * `/etc/mfs/mfsipmap.cfg`
  
- Initialize metadata

    Inside you data path (`/var/lib/mfs`):
    ```
    mkdir -p /var/lib/mfs
    cd /var/lib/mfs
    echo -e "MFSM NEWMETADATA 1\nEMPTY METADATA FILE" > metadata.mfs.empty
    ```
    This creates an empty metadata file, needed for first-time startup.
  
- Start the LizardFS Master

    ```
    mfsmaster start
    ```
