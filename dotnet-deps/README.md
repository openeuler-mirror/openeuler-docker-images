# Usage
In this usage, users can select the corresponding `{Tag}` based on their requirements.

- Pull the `openeuler/dotnet-deps` image from docker

	```bash
	docker pull openeuler/dotnet-deps:{Tag}
	```

- Start a dotnet-deps instance

	```bash
	docker run -d --name my-dotnet-deps openeuler/dotnet-deps:{Tag}
	```
- An example with HelloWorld application example

    1. Obtain the dotnetcore-docs-hello-world source code and navigate to the root directory.
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotnetcore-docs-hello-world
        cd dotnetcore-docs-hello-world
        ```

	2. Modify the dotnetcoresample.csproj file.
        Open the dotnetcoresample.csproj file and update it with the following content:
        ```
        <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
        <PropertyGroup>
            <TargetFramework>net{x.x}</TargetFramework>
            <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
            <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
            <RuntimeIdentifiers>linux-x64;linux-arm64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
        </PropertyGroup>
        </Project>
        ```
        Replace {x.x} with the desired .NET version.

	3. Publish the application.
        ```
        dotnet publish -c Release -o /app -r linux-x64 --self-contained true
        ```
        During execution, the following key information will be displayed:
        ```
        Determining projects to restore...
        All projects are up-to-date for restore.
        dotnetcoresample -> /home/deps/dotnetcore-docs-hello-world/bin/Release/net{x.x}/linux-x64/dotnetcoresample.dll
        dotnetcoresample -> /app/
        ```
	
	4. Run the application using openeuler/dotnet-deps:{Tag}
        ```
        docker run --rm -v /app:/app openeuler/dotnet-deps:{Tag} /app/dotnetcoresample 
        ```
	Note that the .NET version {x.x} used to publish the application must match the version specified by {Tag}.
