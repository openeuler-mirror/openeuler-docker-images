# ONNX Runtime | openEuler
Current ONNX Runtime docker images are built on the [openEuler](https://repo.openeuler.org/). This repository is free to use and exempted from per-user rate limits.

ONNX Runtime is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning accelerator.
ONNX Runtime inference can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. 
ONNX Runtime is compatible with different hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms.

2. Obtain the ONNX Runtime docker image. There are two ways to do this:

- Pull the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub
  - ```docker pull openeuler/onnxruntime```

- Clone the [source repository](https://gitee.com/openeuler/openeuler-docker-images)‚Å†. Navigate to the `AI/onnxruntime` folder and build the image locally with the following command.
  -  ```docker build . -t openeuler/onnxruntime```

3. Run the Docker container to launch the ONNX Runtime developer image.

- ```docker run -it openeuler/onnxruntime```
