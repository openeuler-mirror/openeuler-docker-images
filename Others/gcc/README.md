# GCC | openEuler
Current GCC docker images are built on the [openEuler](https://repo.openeuler.org/). This repository is free to use and exempted from per-user rate limits.

The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, D, Modula-2, and COBOL 
as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system.

# Usage
In this usage, users can select the corresponding `{Tag}` based on their requirements.

- Pull the `openeuler/gcc` image from docker

	```bash
	docker pull openeuler/gcc:{Tag}
	```
 
- Run with an interactive shell

    You can start the container with an interactive shell to run your own code using gcc.
    ```
    docker run -it --rm openeuler/gcc:{Tag} bash
    ```
    
- Example: A minimal gcc program

    Create a file named `hello.c` with the following content:
    ```
    // hello.c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        printf("Hello from GCC %d.%d.%d\n",
               __GNUC__, __GNUC_MINOR__, __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
- Compile the program:
    Use the new version of `gcc` to compile the program:
    ```

    ```
  
- Run the program
    ```
    $ ./hello
