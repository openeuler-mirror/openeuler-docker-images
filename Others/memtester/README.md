# Usage
In this usage, users can select the corresponding `{Tag}`  based on their requirements.

- Pull the `openeuler/memtester` image from docker

	```
	docker pull openeuler/memtester:{Tag}
	```
 
-  Basic Command Syntax

	```
	 memtester <memory_size> <iterations>
	```
 
 	* memory_size: Amount of RAM to test (e.g., 100M, 1G)
    * iterations: Number of test cycles (default: 1)ã€‚

- Example: Test 100MB RAM
   
    Run the following command to test 100MB of memory with 1 full pass:
	```
	memtester 100M 1
	```
    
    Expected Output:
    ```
    ......
    Loop 1/1:
      Stuck Address       : ok         
      Random Value        : ok
      Compare XOR         : ok
      Compare SUB         : ok
      Compare MUL         : ok
      Compare DIV         : ok
      Compare OR          : ok
      Compare AND         : ok
      Sequential Increment: ok
      Solid Bits          : ok         
      Block Sequential    : ok         
      Checkerboard        : ok         
      Bit Spread          : ok         
      Bit Flip            : ok         
      Walking Ones        : ok         
      Walking Zeroes      : ok         
      8-bit Writes        : ok
      16-bit Writes       : ok

    Done.
