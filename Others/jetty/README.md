# Jetty | openEuler
Current jetty docker images are built on the [openEuler](https://repo.openeuler.org/). This repository is free to use and exempted from per-user rate limits.

Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine. Jetty's goal is to support web protocols (HTTP/1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, WebSocket, etc.) in a high volume low latency way that provides maximum performance while retaining the ease of use and compatibility with years of Servlet development.

# Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links
The tag of each `jetty` docker image is consist of the version of `jetty` and the version of basic image. The details are as follows

# Usage
In this usage, users can select the corresponding `{Tag}` based on their requirements.

- Pull the `openeuler/jetty` image from docker

	```bash
	docker pull openeuler/jetty:{Tag}
	```

- Start a jetty instance

	```bash
	docker run -d --name my-jetty -p 8080:8080 openeuler/jetty:{Tag}
	```
	After the instance `my-jetty` is started, access the jetty service through `http://host-ip:8080`. 

- Deployment

    - Webapps can be deployed under /var/lib/jetty/webapps in the usual ways (WAR file, exploded WAR directory, or context XML file). 
    - There is a collection of [examples](https://github.com/jetty/jetty-examples) of how to use various features present in the Eclipse Jetty server and Eclipse Jetty client.
