# Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) | openEuler
Current Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) docker images are built on the [openEuler](https://repo.openeuler.org/). This repository is free to use and exempted from per-user rate limits.

The Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) provides a set of tools and libraries for writing high performance, 
scalable, user-mode storage applications. It achieves high performance by moving all of the necessary drivers into 
userspace and operating in a polled mode instead of relying on interrupts, which avoids kernel context switches and 
eliminates interrupt handling overhead.
