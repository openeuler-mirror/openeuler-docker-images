# Usage
In this usage, users can select the corresponding `{Tag}`  based on their requirements.

- Pull the `openeuler/npdi` image from docker

	```
	docker pull openeuler/npdi:{Tag}
	```

- Run with an interactive shell

    You can start the container with an interactive shell to use npdi.
    ```
    docker run -it --rm openeuler/npdi:{Tag} bash
    ```
  
- Download a sample PCAP

	```
	wget https://wiki.wireshark.org/uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/dns_port.pcap
	```
    **Node:**
    * This file contains DNS packets captured on a non-standard port.
    * It is commonly used to test how deep packet inspection works when protocols run on unusual ports.

- Run ndpiReader to analyze the PCAP
    
    ```
    /nDPI/example/ndpiReader -i dns_port.pcap
    ```
    **Note:**
    * `-i` specifies the input interface or PCAP file.
    * The tool will parse the packets, classify detected protocols, and output basic statistics.
