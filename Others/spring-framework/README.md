# Spring Framework | openEuler
Current Spring Framework docker images are built on the [openEuler](https://repo.openeuler.org/). This repository is free to use and exempted from per-user rate limits.

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.
